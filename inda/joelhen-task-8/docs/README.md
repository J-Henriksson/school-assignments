### Game description
> The world outside lies in ruin, the result of a catastrophic nuclear war. 
> As the lone survivor, you find refuge in the depths of an underground bunker. 
> As you enter the dimly lit bunker entrance the door shuts close behind you. 
> You quickly realize that you are not alone. Inside the bunker roams a deadly radioactive mutant. Your only shot at survival is to explore the bunker and find a way to escape, all while avoiding crossing paths with the mutant. Good luck.

### How to win and lose
> The game is won by succesfully navigating to the bunkers escape room without being caught by the mutant. Being caught by the mutant results in a lose (although depending on which room the player is caught in there is a small chance of survival.)

### Classes added to the game
> Added the MonsterMovement class which is used for calculating and mapping the movement of the mutant.
